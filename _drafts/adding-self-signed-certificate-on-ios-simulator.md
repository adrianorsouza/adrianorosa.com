During the web development it's common to use ios Simulator to test a web page on iOS, on macOS we use iOS Simulator,
but if tring to access a webpage that has a Self Signed certificate Safari will complaint about accessing it. 

So to get around on this just simply drag and drop the `.crt` within the iOS Simulator then you're good to go.
